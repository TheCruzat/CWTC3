This is the updated block theme for my blog, [Coffee With The Cruzat](https://coffeewith.thecruzat.com), completed in September of 2025. This is the third iteration, I had allowed the previous version to get verrry dusty, v2 was left behind in WordPress' jump to an HTML/JS structure.

## Goals

I had several goals in my sights on this build:

- Update theme structure & layout handling
- Retain and translate existing custom post logic in new theme (protecting legacy content)
- Leverage [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for layout development
- Hydrate properly -- water is coffee's best friend

This build is for demonstration purposes only. If you choose to download this theme and try to run it, you will need ACF Pro installed for it to function properly.

## Benediction

I've worked in WordPress for a verrry long time, and this build has all of my bells and whistles, all of my best card tricks. Many of them I've adapted from the work of other developers, we are nothing without our community. If something in here helps you figure out something new and cool, please share it. Feed the garden that has fed you.
